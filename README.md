# RaceTrack
Simple single player car game, which is based on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racetrack_(game). The player controls the speed of the car with the numbers 1 to 9, and can close the game by pressing 0. If 5 is pressed, the speed wont change. The speed is given in (x, y) coordinates and is controlled as follows:

1: (-1, -1), 2: (0, -1), 3: (1, -1), 4: (-1, 0), 5: (0, 0), 6: (1, 0), 7: (-1, 1), 8: (0, 1), 9: (1, 1)

The program will create image files on your computer. The program deletes these files both at startup and shutdown of the program.

The game has two different tracks, a square and rectangular track. The user picks one of these tracks along with the size of the track. 

The game uses a hand drawn car "playerCar.png". 

The file RaceTrack.java uses StdDraw.java which is made by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. 

This program was written for assignment 3 in Introduction to Programming (course 02102) on DTU.

- Playing against a bot
